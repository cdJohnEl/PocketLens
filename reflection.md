# Reflection: AI in the PocketLens Build Process

The integration of AI tools fundamentally transformed how I built PocketLens, from initial scaffolding to final polish. Here’s a detailed reflection on the impact, what worked, what was limiting, and what I learned about prompting, reviewing, and iterating with AI.

## What Worked Well

**1. Rapid Prototyping and Scaffolding:**
AI-powered code completion (Copilot, VS Code AI and v0.dev) made it possible to scaffold new features, API routes, and UI components in minutes. For example, generating a new Next.js API endpoint or a React chart component was as simple as describing the intent in a comment or prompt. This accelerated the early stages of development and reduced boilerplate fatigue.

**2. API-Aware Development:**
By providing OpenAPI specs or endpoint descriptions, I could prompt AI to generate type-safe client code and fetch wrappers. This ensured consistency between frontend and backend, minimized manual errors, and made refactoring safer.

**3. Code Review and Refactoring:**
AI-powered code review tools (like CodeRabbit) flagged subtle bugs, security issues, and style inconsistencies before code was merged. The ability to get instant feedback and suggestions for refactoring improved code quality and confidence in each release.

**4. Documentation and Communication:**
AI was invaluable for keeping documentation up-to-date. It generated clear docstrings, expanded the README with new features, and summarized architectural decisions. This made onboarding easier for new contributors and kept the project maintainable.

## What Felt Limiting

**1. Context Awareness:**
AI sometimes lacked full project context, especially when changes spanned multiple files. This led to suggestions that were correct in isolation but needed manual adjustment to fit the broader architecture.

**2. Prompt Specificity:**
Vague or underspecified prompts produced generic or irrelevant code. I learned that detailed, explicit instructions (including file paths, types, and edge cases) led to much better results. Iterative prompting was often necessary.

**3. Complex Business Logic:**
For nuanced financial logic or security-sensitive code, AI suggestions were a starting point but always required careful review and testing. Human oversight remained essential for critical paths.

## Lessons Learned

- **Prompt Engineering is a Skill:** The quality of AI output is directly tied to the clarity and specificity of prompts. Iterating on prompts and providing examples led to more useful code and documentation.
- **Review is Non-Negotiable:** Even with advanced AI, every suggestion needs review for correctness, security, and maintainability. AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for engineering judgment.
- **AI as a Collaborative Partner:** The best results came from treating AI as a collaborator—using it to accelerate routine tasks, generate ideas, and catch mistakes, while relying on human expertise for design and integration.

Overall, AI made the PocketLens build process faster, more consistent, and more enjoyable. It reduced friction in routine coding, improved documentation, and raised the bar for code quality, but always required thoughtful prompting and review to reach production standards.
