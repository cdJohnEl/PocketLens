# AI Usage in PocketLens

## 1. API-Aware AI: Endpoint Client Generation
- Used AI to generate TypeScript endpoint clients directly from the OpenAPI/Swagger spec for internal API routes (e.g., `/api/upload-receipt`, `/api/get-transactions`).
- AI mapped request/response types, generated fetch wrappers, and provided usage examples in code comments.
- This reduced manual errors and ensured type safety across the app.

## 2. In-IDE AI for Scaffolding
- Leveraged GitHub Copilot and VS Code AI tools to scaffold:
  - New React components (e.g., `ReceiptScanner.tsx`, `InsightsDashboard.tsx`)
  - Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/ai-insights`, `/api/exchange-rates`)
  - Unit and integration tests (Jest, Playwright)
  - Tailwind CSS classes for responsive/mobile layouts
  - Inline documentation and prop types
- AI suggestions accelerated boilerplate creation and improved code consistency.

## 3. AI-Powered Code Reviews
- Used CodeRabbit and Copilot Chat to:
  - Review pull requests for logic, style, and security issues
  - Suggest refactors and highlight anti-patterns
  - Summarize diffs and explain complex changes before merging
- This caught subtle bugs and improved code quality before production deploys.

## 4. AI-Assisted Documentation
- Used AI to:
  - Revise and expand the README with new features and clearer onboarding
  - Generate docstrings and inline comments for major functions and API handlers
  - Summarize architectural decisions and workflow diagrams
- Documentation stayed up-to-date and more accessible for new contributors.

## 5. Prompt Engineering & Iteration
- Iteratively refined prompts to:
  - Get concise, actionable Gemini AI insights for users
  - Generate more accurate test cases and error messages
  - Tune code generation for project conventions
- Prompting skills improved over the course of the project, leading to better AI output and less manual editing.
