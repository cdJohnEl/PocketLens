# Reflections on AI Integration

## Impact on Development
Integrating AI into PocketLens accelerated feature development, especially for complex tasks like receipt scanning and generating financial insights. Using Gemini APIs allowed rapid prototyping and added significant value with minimal code.

## Challenges
- **API Complexity:** Handling authentication, rate limits, and error cases for external AI APIs required careful backend design.
- **Testing:** Mocking AI responses for automated tests was necessary to ensure reliability without incurring API costs.
- **User Trust:** Communicating the limitations of AI-generated insights was important for transparency.

## Lessons Learned
- Server-side AI integration is more secure and scalable than client-side.
- Schema validation (with zod) is essential for handling unpredictable AI responses.
- Clear documentation and user messaging about AI features builds trust.

## Future Improvements
- Add user controls for opting in/out of AI features.
- Explore additional AI models for more advanced analytics.
- Improve error handling and fallback strategies for AI service outages.
