# PocketLens: Your AI-Powered Financial Navigator

## üîñ Project Title & Description

PocketLens is an intelligent personal finance web application that helps users effortlessly track, understand, and optimize their spending. It eliminates the hassle of manual data entry by using a powerful AI-driven receipt scanning feature. Users simply snap a photo of a receipt, and PocketLens automatically logs the transaction, categorizes it, and provides real-time financial insights.

**Who it's for:**
Individuals who want a clearer picture of their spending habits without the tedious work of logging every transaction. PocketLens is for anyone who wants to make smarter financial decisions and gain a deeper understanding of their cash flow.

**Why it matters:**
In today's fast-paced world, managing personal finances is often neglected due to the time and effort it requires. PocketLens simplifies this process, turning a chore into a simple task and empowering users to take control of their financial health with minimal effort. By providing powerful insights from unstructured data (receipts), it gives users a tool that goes beyond traditional budgeting apps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend & Backend (Full-Stack in One)

* **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

  * Reason: Next.js provides both frontend (React) and backend (API routes) in a single framework. This reduces complexity (no need for a separate FastAPI backend) and makes deployment smoother on platforms like Vercel.

* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for responsive, mobile-first design.

* **Charts:** [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for intuitive data visualization of spending trends.

### Backend APIs & Services

* **API Routes:** Built using Next.js API routes (instead of FastAPI) to handle tasks like uploading receipts, fetching transactions, and integrating with AI services.

  * Reason: Reduces the need to maintain a separate backend service and keeps all logic inside the same monorepo.

* **AI/ML Processing:**

  * Use **serverless functions** in Next.js to call external APIs (e.g., OCR, Gemini).
  * For lightweight categorization, we can use **TensorFlow\.js** on the server if we want to avoid Python dependencies.

### Database, Authentication, & Storage

* **Database:** [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for a NoSQL real-time document database.

  * Alternative: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) if we want SQL + edge functions.

* **Authentication:** [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) integrated with Firebase or Supabase.

  * Reason: NextAuth works seamlessly with Next.js and provides secure OAuth/email login.

* **Object Storage:** Firebase Storage (or Supabase Storage) for receipt image uploads.

### AI Services & APIs

* **Receipt OCR:** [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) for extracting text from receipt images.
* **Natural Language Querying:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to let users ask financial questions in plain English.

## üß† AI Integration Strategy (The M.A.S.T.E.R. Plan)

We will use a comprehensive AI-powered workflow to maximize productivity and ensure a high-quality codebase.

* **M**odel Scaffolding & Generation
* **A**utomatic Testing
* **S**mart Documentation
* **T**ooling & Context-Awareness
* **E**rror Analysis
* **R**efactoring

---

### Code Generation & Scaffolding

* **API Endpoints:** Use AI to scaffold Next.js API routes (`/api/upload-receipt`, `/api/get-transactions`).
* **React Components:** AI-generated UI components like `ReceiptScanner.tsx` and `InsightsDashboard.tsx`, styled with Tailwind.
* **Database Models:** Schema definitions for Firestore collections (or Supabase tables).

---


### Testing

* **Unit Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library for UI components.
* **Integration Tests:** Playwright/Cypress to simulate workflows like uploading a receipt and checking dashboard updates.
* **Static Asset Mocking:** Jest is configured to mock static assets (images, SVGs, etc.) using `__mocks__/fileMock.js` and the `moduleNameMapper` option in `jest.config.js`. This ensures tests run smoothly even when components import images or styles.

---

### Documentation

* **Docstrings & Inline Comments:** Auto-generate explanations for major functions in both frontend and API routes.
* **README.md:** AI-assisted updates to keep architecture docs aligned with code changes.

---

### Context-Aware Techniques

* Provide the AI with:

  * Project file tree (helps AI place new routes/components correctly).
  * API specs (`/api/get-transactions` response shape).
  * Code diffs when debugging/refactoring.

## üìí Notes on AI Usage (Tools & Contexts)

### 1. API-Aware AI: Endpoint Client Generation
- Used AI to generate TypeScript endpoint clients directly from the OpenAPI/Swagger spec for internal API routes (e.g., `/api/upload-receipt`, `/api/get-transactions`).
- AI mapped request/response types, generated fetch wrappers, and provided usage examples in code comments.
- This reduced manual errors and ensured type safety across the app.

### 2. In-IDE AI for Scaffolding
- Leveraged GitHub Copilot and VS Code AI tools to scaffold:
  - New React components (e.g., `ReceiptScanner.tsx`, `InsightsDashboard.tsx`)
  - Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/ai-insights`, `/api/exchange-rates`)
  - Unit and integration tests (Jest, Playwright)
  - Tailwind CSS classes for responsive/mobile layouts
  - Inline documentation and prop types
- AI suggestions accelerated boilerplate creation and improved code consistency.

### 3. AI-Powered Code Reviews
- Used CodeRabbit and Copilot Chat to:
  - Review pull requests for logic, style, and security issues
  - Suggest refactors and highlight anti-patterns
  - Summarize diffs and explain complex changes before merging
- This caught subtle bugs and improved code quality before production deploys.

### 4. AI-Assisted Documentation
- Used AI to:
  - Revise and expand the README with new features and clearer onboarding
  - Generate docstrings and inline comments for major functions and API handlers
  - Summarize architectural decisions and workflow diagrams
- Documentation stayed up-to-date and more accessible for new contributors.

### 5. Prompt Engineering & Iteration
- Iteratively refined prompts to:
  - Get concise, actionable Gemini AI insights for users
  - Generate more accurate test cases and error messages
  - Tune code generation for project conventions
- Prompting skills improved over the course of the project, leading to better AI output and less manual editing.
